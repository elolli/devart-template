SoulMusic

## Description
I plan to build an installation that will act as a soundboard controlled by the pulse of the heart. Using sensors, the pulse will represent the frequency of the musical pattern. Additionally, the note will be chosen by where the hand is placed on the wall, using height as a variable of interest, too. The pattern will be represented on the wall with a color corresponding to the musical spectrum. As more and more people interact with the mall, the music will become louder and more diverse and beautiful. The purpose of my project is to combine code and heart beats to create sound that is beautiful to the ears, eyes, and soul and to inspire a universal language of love through art.
